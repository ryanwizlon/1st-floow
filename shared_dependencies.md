The shared dependencies between the files we are generating could include:

1. **Pymander Library**: This is a shared dependency as it is used for rendering scenes in both "ground_reflections.py" and "video_textures.py".

2. **Video File**: The video file used as a texture would be a shared resource between "video_textures.py", "scene_render.py", and "video_texture_text.py".

3. **Scene Data**: The data schema for the scene to be rendered would be shared between "ground_reflections.py", "scene_render.py", and "video_texture_text.py".

4. **Chat GPT Messages**: The message names and schemas for the chat GPT would be shared between "basic_framework.py" and "chat_gpt_passes.py".

5. **Rendering Functions**: Functions for rendering the scene and applying textures would be shared between "ground_reflections.py", "video_textures.py", and "scene_render.py".

6. **DOM Element IDs**: If there is any interaction with a web interface, the ID names of DOM elements manipulated by JavaScript functions could be shared across all files.

7. **Texture Application Functions**: Functions for applying video as a texture would be shared between "video_textures.py" and "video_texture_text.py".

8. **Framework Functions**: Functions for setting up and managing the basic framework would be shared between "basic_framework.py" and all other files.
